                            <p>In order to continue our progress to achieving Net Zero since the base year 2019/20, we have adopted the following carbon reduction target.</p>
                            <p>We project that carbon emissions will decrease over the next five years to 354 tC02e by 2025/26 This is a reduction of 67% from 2019/20 and the projection is to reach net zero carbon by 2030. It is envisaged that carbon offsetting or technology such as carbon capture and storage will be deployed to achieve the difference between actual and net zero carbon.</p>
                            <p>Progress against these targets can be seen in the graph below (2019 to 2021 are actuals 2022 to 2030 are projected):</p>
